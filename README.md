### It occurs to me that there are very few reasons why someone might find themselves at this site. So please, allow me to help.

- Perhaps you are someone who was curious as to why this site was linked to one of my social media profiles perhaps. In which case [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) might help you in trying to find what you might be looking for here.
- Maybe you are simply looking for documentation from a project, which is very likely if you are a student whom i have told to check the documentation for help in which case [this link](https://lib-nexus.github.io/site/docs) is likely the one you want.
- You might also be a prospective employer who has been given this site by me in the hopes that i may have a chance of a position with you or your company. This being the case, you could head to [this link](https://lib-nexus.github.io/site/docs) for documentation for a demonstration of where i am at in terms of being able to explain my work however it is more likely that you are wanting [this link](https://lib-nexus.github.io/site/projects) so that you can look at projects that i have put enough time into for me to be ok to share them.
- It is possible that you are lost and somehow found your way to this site whilst 'stalking' my interweb profiles, hopefully i can bring your scouring to a close with [this link](https://lib-nexus.github.io/site/media) which should contain all social media/interweb profiles that you could need to look at
